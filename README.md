Based on the original work by Steven Mayall. The code was converted from VB.NET to C# with the aim to to futher develop, the plugin, since Steven did not wish to continue working on it.

Once a stable and tested version is ready, it will be available in the Releases section.
From that point onwards, any bugs or improvement suggestions can be reported in the Issues section.
